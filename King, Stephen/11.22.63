One of my favourite books where a high school English teacher in 2011 discovers a "rabbit-hole" at the back of a diner, which takes him to the same exact day in 1958. He decides to stay inside for 5 years, to try and prevent the assassination of John F. Kennedy. But "Father Time" isn't too fond of meddlers.
