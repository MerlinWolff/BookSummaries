Angels and Demons is a story about the resurfacing of an old rival of the Catholic Church - the Illuminati, and their grand, terrifying scheme to catch worldwide attention as they take their revenge for centuries of opression and massacres in the name of faith. We follow Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon and CERN physicist Vittoria Vetra, as they race to find an anti-matter bomb that will obliterate Vatican City, if time runs out.
